#### Electronics and automation engineer
![Electronics and automation engineer](https://arturssmirnovs.github.io/github-profile-readme-generator/images/banner.png)

I simple love everything about coding.
I strive to learn as much programing languages that I can!
I work as an industrial automation engineer but I'm always diving into software development because I consider both areas very important in my line of work.

Skills: Python / C++ / Java / Vba / Plc's

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
